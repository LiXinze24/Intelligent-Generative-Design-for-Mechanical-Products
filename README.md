# Intelligent-Generative-Design-for-Mechanical-Products
Mechanical design integrates domain knowledge, analytical reasoning, and geometric modeling to transform functional requirements into feasible structures. Achieving this process in a truly end to end manner remains challenging, as current Large Language Model (LLM) based approaches still lack three-dimensional (3D) spatial perception, awareness of physical and manufacturing constraints. This work addresses the absence of a unified, scalable and knowledge-grounded intelligent framework for mechanical design by integrating historical design knowledge, multimodal design data and generative intelligence models into an Intelligent Generative Design (IGD) paradigm. Here we demonstrate that the proposed IGD framework effectively integrates general LLMs, the supervised fine-tuned LLM and task-specific neural networks (TNNs) within a multi-agent architecture to perform intent-driven design tasks of analysis decomposition, 3D modeling, 3D assembly and kinematic reasoning, thereby enabling mechanical product design that is directly driven by semantic requirements. The framework covers design workflow and can complete complex mechanical design tasks with high geometric and assembly accuracy and without human intervention. This shows that design intent expressed at the semantic level can directly drive the full mechanical design process, from requirement analysis through detailed modeling and assembly to motion analysis, and that this provides capabilities that were not possible with traditional methods or with approaches that rely on a single neural network modality. The IGD framework provides a viable path for combining generative intelligence models and engineering knowledge in practical workflows that are firmly rooted in real industrial practice, and can support intelligent product development in a wide range of industrial domains.
